# Noto - you notice, you save ðŸ“Œ

Noto is currently in WIP. It's a Pinterest-style board where design-savvy users can pin their amazing images with a small description onto an imaginary white board. I'm doing it as a practise aside from the main [SuperHi](http://superhi.com) course I'm doing.

Current features implemented:
* Viewing all the posts in the main feed
* View a single post from the feed
* Add a new post to the feed
* Edit a post
* Delete a post

Live site: https://noto-mini.herokuapp.com/

The current experience is a bit limited of [Noto](https://noto-mini.herokuapp.com/), but still functioning, feel free to tell me your opinion and say hello@peterjavorkai.com
